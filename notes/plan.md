"My strategy to accomplish this project:


1. Work on it every day because new ideas come over time, also makes it easier to debug.

2. Don't rely on your own knowledge, do research to solve each problem (YT, chatgpt, other people).

3. Clean up the researches and categorize them.

4. Look for new tools, keep yourself updated.

5. Have discipline.

1. Define the requirements:
   - What information do you want to display in the app (e.g. current weather, forecast, location, etc.)?
   - Which weather API will you be using to retrieve the weather data?

2. Set up the project structure:
   - Create separate modules for different functionalities (e.g. API requests, data parsing, user interface).
   - Use a main script to bring everything together.

3. Retrieve weather data from the API:
   - Make API requests to get the weather data based on the user's input (e.g. location).
   - Parse the JSON response to extract the necessary information (e.g. temperature, humidity, wind speed).

4. Display the weather data to the user:
   - Create a simple user interface using a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt.
   - Display the weather information in a visually appealing way (e.g. using icons, colors).

5. Handle errors and edge cases:
   - Make sure to handle cases where the API request fails or there is no data available for the user's location.
   - Provide helpful error messages to the user.

6. Test the app:
   - Test the app thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected.
   - Consider edge cases such as invalid input or network connection issues.
