"My strategy to accomplish this project:


1. Work on it every day because new ideas come over time, also makes it easier to debug.

2. Don't rely on your own knowledge, do research to solve each problem (YT, chatgpt, other people).

3. Clean up the researches and categorize them.

4. Look for new tools, keep yourself updated.

5. Have discipline.
